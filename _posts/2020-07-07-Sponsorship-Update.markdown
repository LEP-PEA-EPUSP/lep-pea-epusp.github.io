# Sponsorship Update


We proudly announce that our project has been qualified to receive financial support from the endownment fund "Amigos da Poli".

See their website at [https://www.amigosdapoli.com.br/](https://www.amigosdapoli.com.br/).

In the next 12 months, we are going to finish all board layouts and schematics, create their documentation and assembly the first PCBs for usage in the Power Electronics Lab.

Thank you for the partnership and for helping us achieve our goals! We are also thankful to STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments for their support.
